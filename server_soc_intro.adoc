== Introduction

The RISC-V server SoC specification defines a standardized set of capabilities
that portable system software such as operating systems and hypervisors, can
rely on being present in a RISC-V server SoC.

A server is a computing system designed to manage and distribute resources,
services, and data to other computers or devices on a network. It is often
referred to as a 'server' because it serves or provides information and
resources upon request. Such computing systems are designed to operate
continually and have higher requirements for capabilities such as RAS, security,
performance, and quality of service. Examples of servers include web servers,
file servers, database servers, mail servers, game servers, and more. This
specification focuses on defining requirements for general-purpose server
computing systems that may be used for one or more of these purposes.

The RISC-V server platform is defined as the collection of SoC hardware,
platform firmware, boot/runtime services, and security services. The platform
provides hardware interfaces (e.g., harts, timers, interrupt controllers, PCIe
root ports, etc.) to portable system software. It also offers a set of
standardized boot and runtime services based on the UEFI and ACPI standards. To
support provisioning and platform management, it interfaces with a baseboard
management controller (BMC) through both in-band and out-of-band (OOB)
management interfaces. The in-band management interfaces support the use of
standard manageability specifications like MCTP, PLDM, IPMI, and Redfish for
provisioning and management of the operating system executing on the platform.
The OOB interface supports the use of standard manageability specifications like
MCTP, PLDM, Redfish, and IPMI for functions such as power management, telemetry,
debug, and provisioning. The security model includes guidelines and requirements
for aspects such as debug authorization, secure/measured boot, firmware updates,
firmware resilience, and confidential computing, among others.

The platform firmware, typically operating at privilege level M, is
considered part of the platform and is usually expected to be customized and
tailored to meet the requirements of the SoC hardware (e.g., initialization
of address decoders, memory controllers, RAS, etc.).

This specification standardizes the requirements for the hardware interfaces and
capabilities (e.g., harts, timers, interrupt controllers, PCIe root complexes,
RAS, QoS, in-band management, out-of-band (OOB) management, etc.) provided by
the SoC to software executing on the application processor harts at privilege
levels below M. It enables OS and hypervisor vendors to support such SoCs with a
single binary OS image distribution model. The requirements posed by this
specification represent a standard set of infrastructural capabilities,
encompassing areas where divergence is typically unnecessary and where novelty
is absent across implementations.

To be compliant with this specification, the SoC MUST support all mandatory
requirements and MUST support the listed versions of the specifications. This
standard set of capabilities MAY be extended by a specific implementation with
additional standard or custom capabilities, including compatible later
versions of listed standard specifications. Portable system software MUST
support the specified mandatory capabilities to be compliant with this
specification.

The requirements in this specification use the following format:

[width=100%]
[%header, cols="5,20"]
|===
| ID#     ^| Requirement
| CAT_NNN  | The `CAT` is a category prefix that logically groups the
             requirements and is followed by 3 digits - `NNN` - assigning a
             numeric ID to the requirement.                                   +
                                                                              +
             The requirements use the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
             "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
             "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" that are
             to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 cite:[RFC_2119] when,
             and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. When
             these words are not capitalized, they have their normal English
             meanings.
2+| _A requirement or a group of requirements may be followed by non-normative
    text providing context or justification for the requirement. The
    non-normative text may also be used to reference sources that are the
    origin of the requirement._
